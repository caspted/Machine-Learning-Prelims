Prelims

1. Why did you choose this dataset?

- I chose this dataset because I was curious regarding the relationship between different symptoms and heart related risk.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

- The model was able to reveal how each independent variable contributes to heart related risk. But for this specific set, it could not properly explain the relationship between the variables due to the nature of the data. A different type of machine learning model like logistics regression is more fitting in this situation.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

- Linear regression is relevant due to its wider application to multiple datasets. It makes it more easier and simpler to interpret relationship between variables and could be the initial choice for exploratory data analysis.

Midterms

1. Does preprocessing affect the result of the model? Why?

- Yes it does affect the result. The reason why is does so is because it normalize and standardize the data making it more clean and consistent. Thus, making the model's performance more reliable.

2. What is your conclusion based on the interpretation or result of your model?

- The model successfully identified three distinct real estate market segments primarily differentiated by price ranges (lower, mid-range, and luxury) rather than by physical attributes alone. This market segmentation offers valuable insights for real estate professionals to develop strategies for each price segment rather than focusing on physical characteristics.
