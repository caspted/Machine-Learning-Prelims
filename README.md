1. Why did you choose this dataset?

- I chose this dataset because I was curious regarding the relationship between different symptoms and heart related risk.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

- The model was able to reveal how each independent variable contributes to heart related risk. But for this specific set, it could not properly explain the relationship between the variables due to the nature of the data. A different type of machine learning model like logistics regression is more fitting in this situation.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

- Linear regression is relevant due to its wider application to multiple datasets. It makes it more easier and simpler to interpret relationship between variables and could be the initial choice for exploratory data analysis.
